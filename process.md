**Analysis - Understanding the Problem - (Initial) Knowledge Crunching and Requirements Definition** 
	
- Writing down some user stories
- Doing event storming
    - using a [E-Scooters EventStorming Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKTpmQkU=/?share_link_id=462632821849)
- Formulating a first version of Ubiquitous language (UL)
- Defining use cases 
    - using [Visual Paradigm](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/)

- [Set of User Stories](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se/e-scooters-case-study/blob/main/user-stories.md)
- [Set of Use Cases](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se/e-scooters-case-study/blob/main/use-cases.md)

    

**From Analysis to Design**

- Defining and coding a first domain model 
- Defining the UI and UX (not discussed in this course)

*DELIVERABLES*

- UML description of the domain model
- An implementation of the domain model in any Object-Oriented language (e.g. Javascript, Python) and 
- UI mocks

**Refining the Analysis and Design: Subdomains and Bounded Contexts**

- Refining the Analysis: Decompose the domain in subdomains
- Refining the Design: Identify Bounded Contexts and the Context Map

*DELIVERABLES*

- ...

**Design - Software Architecture**    

- Defining the Software Architecture of the system
    - Focusing on layered architectures and microservices

*DELIVERABLES*

- ...

**Prototype implementation** 

- Selecting a core subset of the architecture and implement a prototype, capturing key aspects and functionalities
