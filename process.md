**Analysis - Understanding the Problem - (Initial) Knowledge Crunching and Requirements Definition** 
	
- Writing down some user stories
- Doing event storming 
    - using a [E-Scooters EventStorming Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKTpmQkU=/?share_link_id=462632821849)
- Formulating a first version of Ubiquitous language (UL)
- Defining use cases 
	- using [StarUML](https://staruml.io/)  
   - using [Visual Paradigm](https://online.visual-paradigm.com/) 

*DELIVERABLES*

- [UL Glossary](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se/e-scooters-case-study/blob/main/glossary.md)
- [Set of User Stories](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se/e-scooters-case-study/blob/main/user-stories.md)
- [Set of Use Cases](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se/e-scooters-case-study/blob/main/use-cases.md)

    

**From Analysis to Design**

- Building a first domain model, including an implementation 
	- Representing the domain model in UML (Class Diagrams) 
		- using [StarUML](https://staruml.io/) 
- Defining the UI and UX (not discussed in this course)

*DELIVERABLES*

- [A description of the domain model](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se/e-scooters-case-study/blob/main/domain-model.md)
- [An implementation of the domain model](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se/e-scooters-domain-model-monolitic/README.md) in any Object-Oriented language (e.g. Javascript, Python) 
- UI mocks

**Refining the Analysis and Design: Subdomains and Bounded Contexts**

- Refining the Analysis: Decompose the domain in subdomains
- Refining the Design: Identify Bounded Contexts and the Context Map

*DELIVERABLES*

- [Bounded Contexts description](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se/e-scooters-case-study/blob/main/bounded-contexts.md)
- Context Map

**Design - Software Architecture**    

- Defining the Software Architecture of the system
    - Focusing on layered architectures and microservices

*DELIVERABLES*

- [A high-level description of the Software Architecture](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se/e-scooters-case-study/blob/main/sw-architecture.md)

**Prototype implementation and deployment** 

- Selecting a core subset of the architecture and implement a prototype, capturing key aspects and functionalities

*DELIVERABLES*

- [Prototype source code](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se/e-scooters-prototype) and [deployment instruction](https://github.com/unibo-dtm-se/e-scooters-case-study/blob/main/prototype-dev-deplo.md).
